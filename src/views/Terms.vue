                As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide software 
                that facilitates the submission of Steem blockchain transaction data to the Steem blockchain

              </li>
              <li>
                Account and Private Keys. Should you agree to create an Account through our Service, 
                we generate a cryptographic private and public key pair that are provided solely to you 
                and completely owned by you; provided however that we not store passwords or Private Keys for our you. 
                We never have access to your Private Key and do not custody any Private Keys on your behalf, 
                and therefore, assume no responsibility for the management of the Private Key tied to your Account. 
                The Private Key uniquely match the Account name and must be used in connection 
                with the Account to authorize the transfer of STEEM and Steem Dollars from that Account. 
                You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Keys. 
                You must keep your Private Key access information secure. 
                Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of STEEM, Steem Power associated with your Account.
              </li>
              <li>
                No Password Retrieval. We do not receive or store your Account password or Private Keys. 
                Your Private Key is your own and you are solely responsible for their safekeeping. 
                We cannot assist you with Account password retrieval, reset, or recovery. 
                You are solely responsible for remembering your Account password. 
                If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account and password pairs maintained in your Account, 
                you accept and acknowledge that any STEEM and Steem Power you have associated 
                with such Account will become permanently inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transactions. All proposed Steem blockchain transactions must be confirmed and recorded 
                in the Steem blockchain via the Steem distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer network), 
                which is not owned, controlled, or operated by us. 
                The Steem blockchain is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. 
                We have no control over the Steem blockchain and therefore cannot 
                and will not ensure that any transaction details you submit 
                via the Services will be confirmed on the Steem blockchain. 
                You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, 
                or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem blockchain.

                These assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Steem blockchain. 
                The Service does not store, send, or receive STEEM, or Steem Power. 
                Any transfer of title that might occur in any STEEM, 
                or Steem Power occurs on the Steem blockchain and not within the Services. 
                We do not guarantee that the Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any STEEM, or Steem Power.
